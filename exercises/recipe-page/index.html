        <h5>SAUCE</h5>
        <h1>ENTRCOTE STEAK SAUCE</h1>
        <p>
            One of my absolute favorite things to eat in France was steak 
            frites with this sauce. I loved it so much that I had to figure 
            out how to recreate it at home. This version stays true to what I 
            ate there while still being doable in your own kitchen.

                <li>2 tablespoons warm beef broth</li>
                <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ul>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a small pan over medium heat, add <b>2 
                    tablespoons of the butter</b> and let it melt. Add 
                    the minced shallot and cook gently until soft and
                    translucent, without browning.
                 </li>
                <li>
                    Once the shallots are done, remove the pan from 
                    the heat. Add the remaining butter cubes directly 
                    to the pan and stir gently, letting the <b>residual 
                    heat melt the butter slowly</b> until glossy. Set 
                    aside to cool slightly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, 
                    Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon 
                    juice until smooth.
                </li>

                    In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, 
                    Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon 
                    juice until smooth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer the yolk mixture to a blender or food 
                    processor. Add the basil, tarragon, sage, chervil, 
                    anchovies, and capers. Blend until completely smooth 
                    and <b>very thick, like a mayonnaise.</b>
                </li>
                    <li>
                        With the blender running on low, slowly add the 
                        butter and shallot mixture in <b>three 
                        additions,</b> blending well between each 
                        addition until fully incorporated and silky.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the warm beef broth and blend briefly just 
                        until combined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Season with salt, black pepper, and a pinch of 
                        nutmeg. Blend once more to combine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. The sauce 
                        should be creamy, glossy, smooth, and spoonable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve immediately over sliced steak or entrecôte, 
                        ideally with fries.
                    </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
