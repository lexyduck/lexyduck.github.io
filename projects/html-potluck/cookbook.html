                    To a saucepan over medium heat, add the condensed milk, 
                    butter, cocoa powder, and heavy cream. Cook, stirring 
                    constantly, until the butter is melted and the mixture is

                    In a large bowl, mash the ripe bananas until mostly smooth 
                    with a few small chunks left.

                    In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, 
                    baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.

                <li>

                    Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat and add

                    Scoop about 1/2 cup of batter for each pancake, or more 
                    depending on how big or small you like them. Once the 
                    batter hits the pan, sprinkle a few walnuts and mini 
                    chocolate chips right on top before flipping.

                    Cook until bubbles form on top and edges look set, then
